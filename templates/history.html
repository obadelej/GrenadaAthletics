                            <strong>January 11, 1924</strong> - The Grenada Amateur Athletic Association was established

                        <p>
                            The Grenada Athletics Association (GAA), originally founded as the Grenada Amateur Athletic Association, was established on January 11, 1924. It is the governing body for athletics in Grenada and became affiliated with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in 1970. The founding of the association occurred during a period of significant social and political changes in the British Caribbean colonies and was part of a broader movement where sports federations were formed alongside colonial administrative changes.

                            For many years, athletics struggled to gain widespread public attention in Grenada, a country more captivated by cricket. Early athletics competitions were limited by poor infrastructure, such as rudimentary grass tracks, which hampered the development of athletic talent. The first Grenadian athlete to gain regional recognition was William "Pablo" Gittens in the 1950s, who excelled in various events including high jump, long jump, and 400m hurdles.

                            Grenada's international athletics presence began to grow notably in the 1960s and 1970s, marked by participation in the Commonwealth Games starting in 1970 and joining the Central American and Caribbean Championships. Athletes like Dunstan Campbell, who won a bronze medal in decathlon, were part of this early international emergence.
